非典型程序员，热爱计算机与数学。

AI 时代的程序员不应只在单一的技术栈上下功夫，而应更全面地融入产业、产品中。

技术是手段而不是目的，计算机的目的是服务人。

最顶尖的技术，是少数天才研究的范畴，大多数人应朝技术造福于人而努力。

AI 打通了编程语言之间的界限，其理解符号和语言的能力，但因为其没有主动意识，仍然无法自主设计产品。

懂算法、了解人、做产品，才是今后程序员该走的路。

As an atypical programmer driven by passions for computer science and mathematics, I believe:

In the AI era, developers shouldn't confine themselves to singular technical stacks, but rather engage holistically with industries and products. Technology serves as a means, not an end - computing's ultimate purpose is to serve humanity.

While groundbreaking innovations remain the domain of a few geniuses, the majority should focus on harnessing technology for the greater good. AI has dissolved programming language barriers through its symbolic comprehension, yet its lack of proactive intent prevents autonomous product design.

The true path forward lies in threefold mastery: understanding algorithms, comprehending human needs, and crafting products. This trinity of technical proficiency, human insight, and product sensibility defines the modern programmer's calling.
