非典型程序员，热爱计算机与数学。

AI 时代的程序员不应该只在单一的技术栈上下功夫，而应该更全面地融入产业、产品中。

技术是手段而不是目的，计算机最终是要服务于人的。

至于最顶尖的技术，只需交给少数天才研究，大多数人应该想着如何让技术造福于人。

AI 打通了编程语言之间的界限，但因为其没有主动性，仍然无法自主设计产品。

懂算法、了解人、做产品，才是今后大多数程序员的出路。

I'm a non-conventional programmer with a passion for computers and mathematics.

In the AI era, programmers shouldn't focus solely on a single technical stack but should integrate more comprehensively into industries and products.

Technology serves as a means, not an end; computers ultimately exist to serve humanity.

The pinnacle of technological research should be left to a small number of geniuses, while the majority should focus on how technology can benefit people.

AI has broken down the barriers between programming languages, yet due to its lack of initiative, it still cannot independently design products.

Understanding algorithms, comprehending human needs, and creating products—these are the ways forward for most programmers in the future.
